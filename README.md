# ForAll
The DOS program ForAll passes a file list line by line to a user-defined command, 
and passes it to the system as many times as there are lines in the file list.
This program was primarily developed for DOS, but would also run on other operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux etc.).

## Build
The project should be compileable with any Borland C++ version from 2.0 up to and including 3.1 under DOS.
To build ForAll you can use the batch file make.bat in the root directory of the repository.
